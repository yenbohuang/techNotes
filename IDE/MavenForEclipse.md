# User settings

Maven plugin uses a settings file where the configuration can be set. Its path is available in Window|Preferences|Maven|User Settings. If the file doesn't exist, create it and put on something like this:

See "user settings" in <https://github.com/yenbohuang/techNotes/blob/master/Programming/Maven.md>.
    
After editing the file, it's just a matter of clicking on update settings button and it's done. I've just done it and it worked :)
